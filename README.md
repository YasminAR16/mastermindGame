**The Game of Mastermind**

How to play:

First your opponent (i.e. the computer generate the target number) selects a four-digit number. Each of the digits in this number is guaranteed to be unique; further- more the first digit will never be a zero. The player then repeatedly guesses four digit numbers that must be unique (with the same properties as the target number) until correct. When user input is being asked, it appears in a pop-up window. However, the feedback and results of the game are shown in the I/O window.

Rules:

1. User input has to be unique. If not, the welcoming window will continue to pop up asking for a unique four-digit number.
2. The game will only work correctly if exactly four digits are given. If less or more digits than four, the feedback could potentially not be correct.

Feedback from game:

1. For each digit in the guess that appears in the target in the same place in both the target and guess, the word &quot;Fermi&quot; is output.
2. For each digit in the guess that appears in the target, but in a different position, the word &quot;Pico&quot; is output. 
3. If no digits in the guess appear in the target, then the work &quot;Bagel&quot; is output.  
4. A guess consists of anything that doesn&#39;t result in four fermis (correctly guessing).

Ending Game:

The game is over when the target number is correctly guessed exactly. The game congratulates the player and displays the number of guesses the player used. If the user gives the special input guess of &quot;0000&quot;, the game notifies the player they quit, displays what the correct target was, and the number of guesses the player used before conceding the game. 

**Have fun!**
